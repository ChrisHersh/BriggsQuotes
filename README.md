#Briggs Quotes

This project was intended to be a play off of http://nhydock.itch.io/key2joy (My friend's thing), but has deviated a little (pretty much as soon as I started working on the ui (thanks to Joss Steward it looks decent)).

One professor at Shippensburg University, Dr. Briggs, is known for being quite intimidating and having very tough classes. So I decided to have a pleasing atmosphere like in Key2Joy, but with quotes from Dr. Briggs.

As I cannot populate the database as much as I would like I also have the option for others to upload quotes from him, which can be moderated from the admin panel

I have a few things in mind for the future of this project, such as:
+ a voting system to allow people to vote for or against a quote. (DB is set up for this, just need the client code mainly)
  - I would also like it to remember the state based on the IP address of the user, which is why I have the one model already made
+ a more complete RESTful api including put, but delete or post.
    

If you have any ideas for this project do one of the following
- send me an email (ch5968@cs.ship.edu),
- create an issue (eh I suppose it'd work),
- or fork this, code it yourself, and I'll merge it with this if I think it's good enough (I may then add you as a developer if you want)
